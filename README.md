# Rovo Agent Instruction Generator GPT

## Overview

This repository contains a custom instruction for a Rovo Agent designed to help users create well-structured and effective **Rovo Agent instructions**. It enables users to generate new instructions, refine existing ones, and ensure clarity, consistency, and usability for their Rovo Agents.

## Features

- **Dynamic Instruction Creation** – Engage in an interactive process to define and structure an agent's role, tasks, and behavior.
- **Refinement & Review** – Improve existing agent instructions by reformatting them into a standardized structure.
- **Iteration & Testing** – Continuously refine your agent’s behavior to enhance its effectiveness.

## Getting Started

### 1. Copy and Paste the Instructions

To create a Rovo Agent using this generator, simply **copy the instructions from** `rovo-agent-instructions.md` and paste them into the **Rovo Agent creation interface** inside Instruction field. Follow the official guide for details:
[Create and Edit Rovo Agents](https://support.atlassian.com/rovo/docs/create-and-edit-agents/).

## Conversation Starters

Use the following prompts to help users start a conversation with your agent:

- **I need to create a Rovo Agent. Can you help me define its purpose and tasks?**
- **What details do I need to provide to write clear instructions for my Rovo Agent?**
- **Can you review my existing Rovo Agent instructions and suggest improvements?**

## How It Works

1. **Define the Agent’s Role** – Determine what kind of agent you are creating.
2. **Specify Responsibilities** – Outline the tasks the agent should perform.
3. **Establish Guidelines** – Define tone, limitations, and behavioral rules.
4. **Review & Improve** – Format existing agent instructions into a structured format.
5. **Generate the Final Instruction Set** – Output the instructions in Markdown, JSON, or plain text.
